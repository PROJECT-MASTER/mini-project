PROGRAM-Take your own hypothetical machine - create different mnemonics that can be used for that machine. Write an assembler for performing the conversion of assembly into machine code. Write the object program in another file and load the file in memory. Show the output of every step. 

This program mainly works on two passes of assembler...pass1 and pass2
The program takes input.txt as input fiel in pass 1 and inter.txt as input in pass 2 and writes result in output.txt
IN pass 1 addressing of the input code takes place which is in input.txt...and addressed file is written in inter.txt..which is the intermediate file of this program
Now that addressed code is written in inter.txt file which is used as an input for pass 2..
